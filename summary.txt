summary: 
In this lab we worked with creating four different scheduling priorities: first come first serve, 
least remaining time, round robin, and round robin with priority.  When running the scheduling 
algorithms with random values, least remaining time, on average, was able to complete processes 
from arrival time to end time the soonest.  The next quickest algorithms were first come first serve
and round robin priority respectively.  Round robin without the priority, on average, took the 
longest amount of time to complete a process.
