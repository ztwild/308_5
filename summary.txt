summary: 
In this lab we worked with creating four different scheduling priorities: first come first serve, 
least remaining time, round robin, and round robin with priority.  With the values that we tested with,
the least amount of average time spent from arrival time to end time for the processes was for 
least remaining time process.  The most average time spent from arrival time to end time was for the 
round robin process.
